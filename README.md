# DiffEQFinalProject
This repo contains the report and code used to for the final project in my differential equations course. The project revolves around modeling 2 strains of staph infections in a Hospital. We are especially interested in determining the long term behavior of the system and what types of stable or unstable equilibria it might have. 

The project is taken from the differential equation text by Nagle, Saff, and Snider.
